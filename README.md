**Introduction**
Social media platforms like Twitter offer a rich source of text data for sentiment analysis. This project leverages the Twitter Sentiment 140 dataset to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The primary goals are:

To preprocess and clean tweet data.
To build machine learning and deep learning models for sentiment classification.
To evaluate and optimize model performance.
**Dataset**
The Sentiment 140 dataset contains:

Data Size: 1.6 million tweets.
Features:
Text: The tweet text.
Sentiment: Sentiment labels (0 = Negative, 2 = Neutral, 4 = Positive).
